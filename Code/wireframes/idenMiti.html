                        Phishing is a particular type of various social engineering attacks where cybercriminals deceive 
                        unexpecting victims into handing over sensitive information which can include credit card details 
                        and account credentials. Installation of malware also falls under the social engineering method.

                    <p>
                    If  victim has received a phishing email or message, there is a chance that it came with a malicious attachment.
                    It is common for these attachments to have enticing names such as "INVOICE" or "IMPORTANT!" which increases the 
                    probability of the victim opening the email or message.

                    Malicious links can be sent to victims masquerading as safe and legitimate websites. These malicious website often
                    contain scripts that stores user credentials without the victim knowing. Information taken by the script will then be 
                    available to the cybercriminals.

                    There are many types of phishing which cybercriminals use on victims in order to gain valuable information and credentials.

                    Most phishing attacks are done through email phishing. Email phishing is where cybercriminals will register a domain that looks 
                    like a real, genuine company or organisation. The cybercriminals will then send a generic email to thousands of people hoping to 
                    get a response containing information that they have asked for. Creating a fake domain is simple but yet effective. It can often 
                    involve character substitution like using an lowercase ‘L’ in place of an uppercase ‘i’ which look very identical (l & I). <br><br>
                    The example below shows characteristics of a phishing email such as the subject being a confirmation receipt of goods/service that 
                    was not actually purchased; sense of urgency to be opened; and a domain that imitates to be a legitimate vendor/company. <br><br>

                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Spear phisihing is a more sophisticated type of phishing involving email. Spear phishing is where malicious emails are sent to a 
                    specific person. Cybercriminals will most likely know some information about the victim. The information can include but not limited
                    to: <br><br>
                    •Place of employment; 
                    <br>
                    •Job title; 
                    <br>
                    •Email address; and 
                    <br>

                <p>
                    Whaling attacks are even more targeted compared to Spear phishing, taking aim towards Senior Executives of companies. Although the main
                    objective of Whaling is the same as any other types of phishing, the technique used is a lot subtler.<br><br> Using fake links and
                    malicious URLs are not useful as cybercriminals attempt to imitate senior staff of an organisation.<br><br>
                    Whaling emails also commonly use the pretext of a busy CEO who wants an employee to do them a favour.

                    Smishing and Vishing
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Smishing and Vishing replaces emails with telephones/mobile phones as the form of communication. Smishing involves criminals sending 
                    text messages (of content more or less the same that of email phishing), and Vishing involves a telephone conversation. <br><br> One of the 
                    most common smishing pretexts are messages supposedly from your bank alerting you to suspicious activity or your mobile phone network asking 
                    you to pay an additional fee whether or not you are registered with said bank or network. <br><br>
                    Below is a Smishing example of a scammer sending a victim a text message with a malicious link that the victim can click and be redirected to
                    a form that they will fill out. The information put into the form will then be kpet by the scammer to use. This is a characteristics that can
                    be seen in phishing messages Another characteristic of a phishing message is the sender. In the example, you can see that the message is sent 
                    from a regular UK mobile number. Usually, message from actual banks such as HSBC or Barclays, will show up as that bank. <br><br>
                    <div class="single-service"><img src="../images/smishingEx.PNG"/> </div>

                    It is worth remembering that contents of a phishing will be very similar to one you would find in a phishing email.

                    Angler phishing
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Angler phishing is a relatively new phishing vector. Social media offers a number of ways cybercriminals can trick people and the user of the platform
                    through the use of fake URLs; cloned websites, posts, and tweets; instant messaging (for example Instagram Direct Messages). These can be used to persuade
                    users and people to disclose sensitive information or even download malware.<br><br>
                    The example below demonstrates Angler phishing. It is often made possible due to the number of people containing organisations directly on social media with complaints.
                    <div class="single-service"><img src="../images/anglerPhi.png"/> </div>
                    Organisations will often use these as an opportunity to mitigate damage – usually by giving the person a refund or helping them with the issue. <br><br> However, 
                    cybercriminals are adept at hijacking responses and asking the customer to provide their personal details. They are seemingly doing this to facilitatesome form of 
                    compensation for them, but it is instead done to steal the given information which can be used to compromise the victim’s account. <br><br>

                    <p><strong>
                    1. Demanding Urgent Action
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Emails threatening negative consequences, or a loss of opportunity unless you take action, are often phishing emails. Cybercriminals will use this approach to rush victims
                    into action before they figure out that the email they were sent is illegitimate through flaws and inconsistencies.

                    </p><strong>
                    2. Bad Grammar and Spelling Mistakes
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Bad grammar and spelling mistakes is often a big red flag in phishing emails and messages. The companies criminals are trying to imitate are unlikely to have any spelling errors
                    or have bad grammar in the messages they send to their clients. Seeing bad grammar and spelling errors in emails and messages can and will mean that it is of malicious intent.

                    </p><strong>
                    3. Requesting Login Credentials, Payment Information or Sensitive Data
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Emails and messages from an unexpected or unfamiliar sender that request login credentials, bank details or other sensitive information should always be treated with caution before 
                    making a move. Cybercriminals are able to forge login pages to look legitimate and send an email containing a link to the malicious page. As a recipient, you should refrain from 
                    clicking and inputting information on such forms unless you are 100% sure that it came from a legitimate sender and that the link is not deceptive in any way, shape or form.
                    </p><strong>
                    4. Suspicious Attachments
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Work-related file sharing now takes place either through internal networks of a company or through third-party services such as OneDrive or Dropbox. Emails with attachment should always
                    be treated suspiciously especially if they have an unfamiliar extension such as .zip,.exe, etc.

                    </p><strong>
                    5. Too Good to Be True Emails and Messages
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Too good to be true emails and messages are those which incentivize the victim to click on a link, open an attachment, or reply back. By doing so, they will be rewarded in some way either 
                    through money, vouchers or even trips abroad.

                <p>
                    You should always think about what may happen when you receive an email. Did you expect it? Is it too good to be true? Logos and names are often replicated and you should not always rely on it.

                    You may use email as a form of communication method for your work and requests such as what time a meeting will be are fine, more often than not. So if an email is asking for your login credentials and bank bank details, be weary.

                    All social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to get past victims’ natural wariness, such as: <br><br>
                    •Creating a false sense of urgency and heightened emotion to confuse their victims;
                    <br><br>

                    Before putting any details in a website, make sure to check for the SSL certificate. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate ensures that all data passed from the browser to the website's server is secure. Don't give information to an unsecured site.

                    You should change your passwords regularly which differs from each service to service and site to site. You should also change your passwords immediately if you have any doubt that your account has been compromised.
