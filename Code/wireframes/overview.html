                        Phishing is a particular type of various social engineering attacks where cyber criminals deceive 
                        unexpecting victims into handing over sensitive information which can include credit card details 
                        and account credentials. Installation of malware also falls under the social engineering method.

                        As complicated as phishing may seem, cyber criminals commonly only use one of two basic methods:

                    <p><strong>
                        Malicious attachments
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                    If  victim has received a phishing email or message, there is a chance that it came with a malicious attachment.
                    It is common for these attachments to have enticing names such as "INVOICE" or "IMPORTANT!" which increases the 
                    probability of the victim opening the email or message.
                    </p>

                        Malicious links 
                    </strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Malicious links can be sent to victims masquerading as safe and legitimate websites. These malicious website often
                    contain scripts that stores user credentials without the victim knowing. Information taken by the script will then be 
                    available to the cyber criminals.
